need to solve:
1. way to label streaming( from emoticon , how?)
2. emoticon have way higher weight( remove emotion and train it again)
3. "I feel great" & "I don't feel great" (negative word. not_great )
4. tfidf or just count as 1,0

5. stop word, stem word..( c++ plugin seems not easy to write, preprocess before throw to jubatus)

take out stop word first, then tag it.. want to have ['N', '^', 'V', 'A', 'R', '!',]


delta tfidf
